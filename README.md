The purpose of this project is to intake a degree catalog with required classes for a major and minor (if desired)
The output is an excel spreadsheet with a sample class plan with semesters laid out, integrating a minor or a second major
The calcuation portion is comparing a webscan (using python/Flask) of all the required classes for the minor and seeing how they can integrate into the main major

The example I am creating is comparing different minors to go with my Electrical Engineering major (computer engineering vs physics vs etc)
I want to see my different options and what minors I can take feasibly with my major as is (essentially mix and match)

The output is an easy to read excel spreadsheet that has all different combinations of majors/minors specified

Constraints to be implemented would be credits able to take in one semester (18)

Current version works with both CU Boulder and CSU major catalog
